            "The U.S. federal government shut down on October 1, 2025, after President Donald Trump's administration and congressional Democrats failed to agree on funding legislation. Democrats insisted on reversing Medicaid cuts and extending Affordable Care Act health subsidies, while Republicans refused, triggering a lapse in appropriations. This action, guided by the Antideficiency Act, mandates the cessation of \"non-essential\" government functions.\n",

            "During the shutdown, crucial \"essential\" services continue operating without immediate pay. These include active-duty military personnel, federal law enforcement (FBI, DEA, Secret Service, Border Patrol, ICE), air traffic controllers, and airport security screeners (TSA). Mandatory spending programs such as Social Security, Medicare, Medicaid, and veterans' benefits also proceed uninterrupted. The U.S. Postal Service, being self-funded, remains unaffected.\n",
            "\n",
            "Conversely, \"non-essential\" operations halt, impacting hundreds of thousands of federal employees who are either furloughed (placed on temporary unpaid leave) or required to work without pay. While federal employees are legally guaranteed back pay once funding resumes, private-sector federal contractors lack this assurance. The shutdown leads to national parks and monuments closing or offering reduced services, delays in vital economic reports (like jobs and inflation data), curtailment of FDA animal food safety reviews, and risks to programs like WIC if prolonged. A notable escalation from previous shutdowns is the Trump administration's threat of permanent layoffs (Reductions in Force) for employees in non-priority programs. The economic fallout includes a direct reduction in GDP and significant financial hardship for affected families. This marks the 21st federal shutdown, with the 2018-2019 instance being the longest at 35 days.\n",
